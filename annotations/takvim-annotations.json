With his benevolent intention of caring for his subjects, this is the special article describing the imperial journey to the Dardanelles and Edirne that took place several months ago, with which this newspaper has been auspiciously inaugurated.</p><p>His Majesty our Sovereign of fine conduct is characterized by his care for his subjects. Although news and the science of geography have informed His Imperial Majesty to some extent, following the principle that &ldquo;hearing is not like seeing,&rdquo; [His Majesty resolved] to observe with his own eyes&mdash;both the Muslim and non-Muslim subjects' conditions, and the fortifications and state of the imperial fortresses&mdash;with complete compassion. As an auspicious and unprecedented beginning, with humble condescension, His Majesty chose to burden his precious imperial person with travel, and to announce and demonstrate his inherent compassion as a sovereign to the poor.</p><p>Departing from Istanbul on the twenty-second of the noble month of Dhu'l-Hijja 1246 [May 22, 1831], which fell on a Friday, after performing the Friday prayer, His Majesty boarded the frigate named Şeref-resan [Honor-Bestowing] and departed for the Dardanelles with the Imperial Fleet. The fleet consisted of three ships-of-the-line, four frigates, four corvettes, one steamship, and two cutters&mdash;totaling fifteen vessels.</p><p>His Majesty stayed six days in Gallipoli and performed the Friday prayer at the Gazi Süleyman Pasha Mosque, led by the Second Imam of his royal retinue, Mustafa Nuri Efendi, one of the senior professors. After the prayer, he departed with the fleet for Kale-i Sultaniye [Çanakkale]. After one week, leaving the Imperial Fleet at the strait, His Majesty traveled by steamship [back toward Edirne].</p><p>On the sixth of Muharram [1247], a Friday, after again performing the prayer, His Majesty returned to Gallipoli. On the seventh of the month, departing at dawn, he proceeded overland to Oreşe, Keşan, and Cisr-i Ergene, staying at the notables' mansions designated for his lodging. At the farm named Kara Kasım, three hours from Edirne, His Majesty spent one night.</p><p>On the eleventh [of Muharram], a Wednesday, His Majesty arrived at a place half an hour from Edirne. From the Solak Fountain, with a grand procession arranged in his honor, he proceeded toward the Selimiye Mosque. In its vicinity, at the mansion of the Grand Vizier's sword-bearer Raşid Ağa&mdash;which is new and pleasant and was designated as the imperial palace&mdash;His Majesty deigned to honor [with his presence].</p><p>From the mentioned fountain, the Molla of Edirne and all the ulema and sheikhs prepared for the imperial reception. The schoolteachers with all their pupils, and the Greek, Armenian, and Jewish priests and rabbis with their children, wearing their ceremonial garments, stood along the royal road, raising their voices in prayer and praise. All the people lined up along the roads with complete joy, and by observing the imperial countenance, they were gratified.</p><p>From Gallipoli to the protected city of Edirne, the deputies, notables, and leading figures of the lands that His Majesty inspected came from places half an hour away, gratefully and thankfully welcoming the royal arrival. Each official was honored by being clothed in ferâce and kukuleta robes of honor. In each place, however many poor Muslims and non-Muslim subjects there were, they were registered and abundant alms were given on their behalf. Previously, what was called the &ldquo;dörice house&rdquo;...</p><p style='font-style: italic; color: #666;'>[Continues in left-hand column]</p><p style='font-size: 0.8em; color: #999;'>43 lines.

Similarly, substantial amounts required were given to the inhabitants and subjects of the districts within the Çirmen Sanjak. [His Majesty] commanded [this], and they became recipients of [the people's] prayers.</p><p>In Gallipoli, however many mosques, fountains, and schools there were, their repair was ordered, along with the water channels whose conduits had been broken for a long time. Blessed sites were visited, especially in Bolayır, where Gazi Süleyman Pasha's tomb was visited, and alms were given to its tomb-keepers and to the poor.</p><p>The notables of Gallipoli wished to arrange a grand banquet at their own expense for the imperial retinue in Bolayır, but with the consideration that it might burden the common subjects, [His Majesty] ordered its abandonment. In this way, it was shown that the comfort of the poor was paramount in His Imperial consideration.</p><p>[His Majesty inspected] the Sultaniye Fortress, Kilid-ül-Bahr [Key of the Sea], Kum Kale [Sand Fortress], Sedd-ül-Bahr [Barrier of the Sea] fortresses, Nara Point, and in those environs&mdash;including the imperial bastions [built previously by His Majesty]&mdash;and the fortifications of Bozcaada's fortress. At Kilid-ül-Bahr Fortress, [His Majesty] ordered the firing of the large cannons&mdash;each firing four-kantar shots with thirty-six okka of gunpowder. The artillery chief and soldiers, although they aimed at the target, due to the awe of the Sultan's presence, proper attention was not paid. With imperial instruction regarding the aiming, when fired again, the shots ricocheted nine times more and penetrated about five arşun [approximately 3.5 meters] into the ground.</p><p>All the fortress officers, imams, and servants received robes of honor and gifts. The poor subjects also attained abundant alms.</p><p>[His Majesty] resided in the protected city of Edirne for ten days. The first Friday prayer was performed at the Selimiye Mosque, and the second Friday at the Üç Şerefeli [Three-Balconied] Mosque, following the Second Imam Efendi. Blessed sites were visited, and gifts were bestowed upon the poor and dervishes.</p><p>[His Majesty visited] twice the Çirmen Governor Hüseyin Pasha's gardens at the confluence of the Maritsa and Tunca rivers, and once Tağdeviran-zade Kadri Bey's garden on the Tunca riverbank.</p><p>[His Majesty] honored the Mansure [Victorious] Soldiers' barracks, viewing its four sides place by place and entering its noble mosque. The soldiers stood battalion by battalion, and passing through their midst, His Majesty gained personal awareness of each one's clothing, conditions, and states. Governor-General Ahmed Pasha, commander of the Special Division, was openly ordered to show kindness to the soldiers.</p><p>[His Majesty] also personally gained information about the hospital's conditions and ordered its repair and renewal. On the Maritsa River, the great bridge that had collapsed from flooding&mdash;its renewal was ordered. The people, saved from hardship, became devoted to praying for the continuation of His Majesty's state.</p><p>The exalted visit to the protected city of Edirne is hereby remembered and commemorated...</p><p style='font-style: italic; color: #666;'>[Text continues on next page]</p><p style='font-size: 0.8em; color: #999;'>43 lines.
